# Apollo Server GraphQL Node
This project shows us a functional graphql project working in Node environment

## Why i care GraphQL so much?
I think graphql is important when you are working with multiple databases, rest API or other services, with GrahQL you can join them in a single app and be consumed by a frontend app.
The consume by the frontend app will be more fast
- With graphQL you choose what you want from the backend
- Apollo comes with a build-in state manager via cache, you don't need to create in the frontent. you can configure the cache instead.
